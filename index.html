<h2 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h2><p>During the spring semester of 2018, the University of Idaho redesigned their website and updated their brand, revising the official logos and color schemes (University of Idaho 2018). Like many libraries, the University of Idaho Library independently hosts and maintains its own website, so this university-wide rebranding meant the library website would need a “refresh” as well, to avoid being out of sync with the new look and feel. One might think this would be as easy as swapping out the web banner logo and updating the accent colors (Figures 1 and 2).</p><figure><img src="DtNFdB.jpg" title="Figure 1" alt="university of idaho logo with metallic gold lettering" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">university of idaho logo with metallic gold lettering</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 1. The old University of Idaho Library Logo, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180224063150/https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" class="uri">https://web.archive.org/web/20180224063150/https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/</a></p><figure><img src="JGJxZF.jpg" title="Figure 2" alt="university of idaho logo with large I" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">university of idaho logo with large I</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 2. The new University of Idaho Library Logo, 1/30/2020.</p><p>However, as University of Idaho librarians soon discovered, this cosmetic update was not so simple. Attempts at a quick patch for the new branding were unsatisfying, prompting a long, considered look at the evolving needs of the library’s users and the library’s overall approach to producing the website. In June 2018, the Library’s web team decided that the library needed to completely overhaul its website and development process, and that process needed to be completed by the start of the fall semester in early August. In effect, the university’s brand refresh triggered a cascade of change in the technical stack, workflows, and culture behind the library’s website—all in a few short months.</p><div class="box"><p>Markdown content within the box! Such as:</p><p><strong>A List:</strong></p><ul><li>list item</li><li>list item</li><li>list item</li></ul></div><p>An academic library’s website plays a crucial role in how it is perceived and utilized by patrons and visitors. Rebuilding that website and establishing a new development style can be an exceptionally difficult process: librarians face an increasingly overwhelming array of choices for deciding on a web platform that fits their context. Investing in an effective platform almost always involves exchanging a certain amount of control over a site’s structure and content in order to gain ease of use or convenience. In part, this is a result of libraries lacking dedicated resources and staffing to create and maintain a website full-time. Historically, many libraries have built websites using content management systems (CMS) that allow for participation from staff without formal web development training, yet are expensive, difficult to customize, and prone to security issues. On the other hand, libraries that forgo a CMS often find that collaborative participation in web design and deployment is restricted only to those with the requisite technical skills.</p><p>Not wanting to submit to the lack of control that a CMS requires, yet still desiring an effective means of collaboration, librarians at the University of Idaho Library have developed a modern static web approach for building the library website that offers a viable middle-way. Using the static site generator Jekyll to simplify modular development and the code hosting platform GitHub to facilitate collaboration, librarians produced a complete website composed of static assets without the server-side processing and databases used by dynamic web applications such as CMS. This provided a low-cost, highly customizable, and secure solution with minimal infrastructure requirements.</p><p>This case study explores the theoretical reasoning behind implementing a static library website and the practical steps taken to establish an agile yet sustainable development model. Ultimately, the site’s creators have found that the most important result of this process is not technical, but social and organizational. The ideals and methods of the static web approach have contributed to an inclusive web development environment in which increased participation empowers librarians and staff to learn and work with basic web development languages and concepts, in turn producing a more robust and uniquely customizable library website.</p><h2 id="static-web-approach-to-library-website-development">Static Web Approach to Library Website Development</h2><h3 id="deciding-against-using-a-content-management-system">Deciding Against Using a Content Management System</h3><p>For many years, the University of Idaho Library website was built using an idiosyncratic PHP-based workflow. At their most efficient, technical tools reflect the cultural needs of the organization. Here, this workflow was effective for the needs of a lone developer, the Digital Initiatives Librarian (now Head, Data and Digital Services), who completed most editing and maintenance of the site as a team of one. He used a series of HTML templates with PHP includes to create each page. The PHP includes pulled in page elements such as headers, navigation, and footers to ensure the overall theme remained consistent across the site. Although some content was pre-generated from XML data using XSLT, most of the content was manually maintained by editing the HTML files. The full assets of the website were duplicated on a test and production server with PHP installed. All development, testing and backing up was done on the test server that was only accessible to select computers in the library offices, limiting the ability to work remotely or test the site with larger groups.</p><p>Although this type of home-grown PHP framework is not unique for generating library websites (Northrup, Cherry, and Darby 2017), it can become cumbersome to maintain at scale and difficult to bring in collaborators with different levels of expertise. Instead, it is far more common for libraries to create websites using a Content Management System (CMS). Research on academic libraries’ websites by Connell (2013) revealed that 64% of academic libraries surveyed were using CMS such as Drupal, WordPress, or LibGuides, most often the same platform used by their parent institution. A scan of the fourteen public university libraries in the Orbis Cascade Alliance, University of Idaho’s regional academic library consortium, completed in January 2020, demonstrated that this trend has continued. Of the fourteen, 85% use an identifiable CMS (five Drupal, five WordPress, two others), with eight using the same platform as their university, two an older version of the platform, and only four establishing something different (Williamson 2020).</p><p>The major CMS platforms such as WordPress and Drupal are complex software that utilize a server-side programming language and database to generate a web-based administrative interface and public facing website. They can offer powerful functionality out of the box including nuanced user management, ecosystems of plugins to add features, and professional themes. For large organizations, a CMS’s ability to establish minute controls over user rights—delegating roles between content editors, web designers, and ITS maintainers—is often especially important. Once established and properly configured, a CMS can enable non-expert users without HTML or CSS skills to rapidly create and edit web content. These upsides have encouraged adoption throughout the last decade and can transform content creation in the context of a library website (Hubble, Murphy, and Perry 2011; Buell and Sandford 2018).</p><p>CMS-based functionality, however, comes with high infrastructure costs, requiring powerful servers for their performance, expert developers for their configurations, and IT professionals to maintain system coherence and security over time. Migration from one major version to the next is never trivial, and even routine maintenance necessary to ensure basic site security requires sophisticated, system-specific knowledge to perform and troubleshoot. Role creation and user management can lead to inefficiencies and frictions in workflows with the continual need for role upkeep and assignment. As Yeh et al.’s (2016) research articulates, these common challenges and need for expert support often catch adopters off-guard. In terms of library websites, a CMS may facilitate content creation, but the IT requirements often mean a library must give up significant control of its web pages in order to adopt the university’s platform.</p><p>For example, the University of Idaho Library has been offered (and declined) the use of the university’s proprietary CMS Sitecore, which is managed by the University's web communications unit. Like other CMS products, Sitecore offers the ability to centralize design, branding, and architecture while allowing users from across the university to publish their own content. The result is a coherent, well-branded website, but little of the webpage themes or functionality can be customized by individual units. While the library’s web team acknowledges how important it is to mirror the familiar look and feel of the university sites to ensure an uninterrupted experience for users, the library’s website requires more flexibility and agility than the CMS offers. The library’s site content and functionality are continuously evolving, reflecting researchers' ever-changing needs to efficiently connect with diverse resources and services.</p><p>This independent position offers freedom and opportunity in managing library web properties, but it also requires greater responsibility. In response, the librarians at the core of the web team have developed a pragmatic approach that makes the most of in-house expertise, minimizes infrastructure needs, and respects the unique values of the library, all while ensuring a high-quality experience for users.</p><h3 id="developing-a-static-web-approach">Developing a Static Web Approach</h3><p>To make building and collaborating on a large website possible without a CMS platform, University of Idaho librarians use a modern static web approach powered by the static generator Jekyll and the version control platform GitHub. Static website generators are tools that transform a folder of structured source code into a complete website, building each page as a static asset. The generator works by iterating over source files containing the content, templates, configuration options, and data to build out the HTML, CSS, and JS that make up a website. These generated files can then be copied onto a minimal web server. The static site generator pre-builds all the pages a user might encounter, in contrast to dynamic web CMS platforms that render each page on-the-fly using a database and server-side processing.</p><p>Static web generators have experienced a renaissance since around 2015, emerging as a viable alternative for projects of any size due to their simplicity and performance (Biilmann 2015). Combining the power of themes found in CMS with the pure customization of straight HTML, static site generators trade the GUI ease of the CMS platforms for minimal simplicity that provides a more fundamental level of control and the ability to use data to drive content creation. The web infrastructure is simplified, which lowers the IT barriers that databases and server requirements often impose. At the same time, users interface with the system at a lower level, increasing the difficulty of their initial learning process, but also opening greater opportunities to fully understand the technologies driving the site.</p><p>Part of the recent appeal of static generators is driven in response to changing user behavior. As smartphones and mobile data became the norm, user expectations for websites shifted significantly, requiring both responsive designs that function on any size screen and efficient delivery of content at slow connection speeds. Even on the University of Idaho Library website, which features mostly research-related tasks, mobile users continue to steadily rise, from approximately 19% in 2017 to 27% in fall semester 2019 (based on Google Analytics), and bandwidth is a significant concern in a rural state like Idaho. Since static site generators pre-build every page as a static file rather than relying on the server-side processing of CMS, they can provide extremely fast performance, even hosted on the most basic web servers.</p><h3 id="choosing-jekyll-as-a-static-web-generator">Choosing Jekyll as a Static Web Generator</h3><p>University of Idaho librarians evaluated a wide variety of static site generators, eventually settling on Jekyll for a variety of reasons. First, Jekyll is set up so it supports a simple mental model of how the site will be built that matches up with traditional web development approaches. Static assets in a folder in the source code will become static assets in the same location on the built-out site. Content is represented by stub files that are assigned a layout that pulls together the modular template elements of each web page. This arrangement is similar to the library’s earlier templates of PHP includes, built into a tool that makes the approach considerably more powerful and sustainable. University of Idaho librarians’ experiences teaching others during classes, workshops, and internal sessions suggest that the biggest barrier to getting started with Jekyll is setting up the development environment, including Ruby, the programming language necessary to run it. Once past that initial hurdle, learners without a development background are able to understand how the tool works and web pages are constructed. In contrast, some of the major alternatives, such as Hugo, GatsbyJS, and Next.JS, seem to rely on a more formal computational mental model for constructing sites, making them amenable to JavaScript developers, but less intuitive to an average librarian.</p><p>Second, Liquid, the templating language used by Jekyll, is powerful yet easy to learn, opening new possibilities for driving content generation from simple data formats such as CSV. This ability to use data created and edited in spreadsheet formats, allows rethinking much of the website content as re-usable chunks added into pages using flexible templates. Spreadsheets are something library folks have plenty of experience with, providing an easy entry point for collaborators to create, organize, and maintain content on the site.</p><p>Finally, Jekyll has become the most popular out of the myriad of emerging static generators. This is in part due to being integrated into GitHub's free web hosting service, GitHub Pages, making it an attractive option for quick projects and learning opportunities. The vibrant community around these tools results in better support when encountering issues and a wide ecosystem of quality examples to draw from.</p><p>On the surface, “popularity” might seem like a shallow metric to consider when selecting tools, but it has become a significant factor when evaluating the sustainability and usability of different technology choices. In the library’s context, ready availability of quality documentation and help resources can lower the barriers for learning and use. Additionally, tools such as Jekyll, Bootstrap, and GitHub have huge novice user communities that ask questions and post answers across the web. A quick, specific search will almost always return solutions that are comprehensible to non-computer scientists for any issue one encounters. This accessibility of help resources and a community of users is essential to fostering a library-centric approach as well as keeping the workflow "do-able" for University of Idaho librarians and, the authors argue, for librarians generally.</p><h3 id="using-version-control-for-better-site-maintenance-and-collaboration">Using Version Control for Better Site Maintenance and Collaboration</h3><p>Jekyll’s connection to GitHub also led to an important improvement in the library’s collaborative development practices: the establishment of a version control system and platform. Previous "version control" was manual, i.e., versions were communicated via a series of filenames like index_new.html, index_new-edited.html, and index_better-new-edited.html. This is obviously very prone to error and confusion, leading to an ever-growing maze of filenames and folders. To better manage the history of development (and the Digital Infrastructure Librarian’s workload), the library began using the distributed version control system Git with the platform GitHub to host source code repositories. University of Idaho librarians were also attracted to using GitHub because of its emphasis on open code and content sharing, factors that make GitHub popular with librarians at other institutions as well (Davis 2015; Eaton 2018).</p><p>When using Git on a project, each set of changes is stored in the repository history as a “commit,” like a series of snapshots permanently recording who, what, when, and why. Git also provides the capability of branching and merging, creating an independent copy of the code that can be modified then intelligently re-combined. These features enable collaboration, allowing users to bravely test out new ideas and features without disrupting the current working version or fear losing code.</p><p>GitHub provides additional web-based features to facilitate collaboration, which help team members visualize each other’s work, track projects, and have conversations directly within the code. By making the team’s work visible, GitHub allows the group to better understand what everyone is doing and move forward on the project simultaneously. Finally, the code is available anywhere, allowing collaborators to work outside of office desktops. While a variety of alternative platforms exist, such as Bitbucket and Gitlab or even self-hosted solutions, GitHub seemed to have the most usable web interface, friendly documentation, and largest community, making it an extremely popular repository service and obvious choice for the library’s needs.</p><h3 id="building-a-template-for-the-redesign">Building a Template for the Redesign</h3><p>Several requirements guided the overall project design for the new library web template. The new site needed to:</p><ul><li>follow the University's updated branding guideline for logos, colors, and fonts;</li><li>echo the main university website's look and feel, while maintaining the old library website's unique features, functionality, and structure;</li><li>preserve page locations to avoid broken links;</li><li>and improve responsive design to ensure better usability on all devices.</li></ul><p>To build the new template the library web team evaluated a variety of CSS and JS frameworks, which facilitate quick development by providing standardized design components, classes, and functions. The old site used an out-of-date version of Bootstrap 3 with extensive customization and inline styles that made it difficult to maintain. Since Bootstrap continues to be perhaps the most popular framework on the web, the web team decided to update to the most recent version (4.x) and remove the old customizations to ensure simpler maintenance going forward.</p><p>Next, the Digital Infrastructure Librarian set up a skeleton structure for the Jekyll project. Using the affordances of the generator, he aimed to create a clear separation of content and design template elements. This not only simplifies maintenance but enables a lower barrier to contributions from collaborators with different skills and expertise. Rather than individual documents, the content is envisioned as data that could be migrated into a variety of templates or platforms, or transformed in bulk, making it future and preservation ready. Additionally, numerous pages presented content in repeating elements on the page such as cards, accordions, or tables. These repeating chunks in the documents can be better represented as tabular data, thus he aimed to move this content into spreadsheets.</p><p>Migrating content from the old site was more complex than expected, since the server contained hundreds of files that were no longer in use but lingered for historical reasons. To parse this maze, the Digital Infrastructure Librarian used a web crawler to traverse the website creating a list of pages that were discoverable and active. Using this data, he carried out bulk content migration using Python. Content from each active page was extracted out of the old template by parsing the HTML, cleaned using regular expressions, then exported to a new stub file with the correct format for the Jekyll-based redesign project. This created a raw base for the content, which would need further editing and auditing to ensure everything was up to date.</p><p>With the base project source code hosted on GitHub, the initial team of two librarians worked through quick iterations to create the new design, rapidly testing features and styles using Jekyll's built-in development server. Using GitHub Pages hosting, the draft version was published on the live web so it could be reviewed by others and tested on a variety of devices while still in continually active development. Getting feedback early and often is a central feature of an agile approach that helps efficiently direct development efforts. At this point the team of two was about to get bigger, putting the new communication and collaboration workflow to the test.</p><h2 id="effects-on-collaboration">Effects on Collaboration</h2><h3 id="cross-departmental-development-using-agile-inspired-development-principles">Cross-departmental Development using Agile-inspired Development Principles</h3><p>As the redesign process ramped up, the Head of Data and Digital Services (DDS) department issued an open call to all library employees to join the Library’s annual Web Committee meetings, hoping to gain new members and include as many people as possible in the process, due to the large scope of work to be accomplished. Traditionally, the University of Idaho Library does no large revisions to its website during the academic year, believing that consistency is important for efficient use of the site. This means most of the major revisions and new features are developed over the summer months when the Library’s Web Committee meets and works. Library Web Committee members typically gather feedback and input, open channels of communication, and form working groups to take on new web projects.</p><p>For a year prior to the redesign, the DDS department had been experimenting with using Agile-inspired development sprints (https://agilemanifesto.org/) to help improve departmental products, communication, and workflows. That experience, combined with the many constraints presented during the redesign project, led to the initiation of a similar process for the entire Library Web Committee to facilitate the development of the website template and complete migrating the content. Following the Agile sprint model, the committee met every day for two weeks for 15 to 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon. Small groups were assigned specific tasks, and committee members were constantly consulted about the new designs and features being developed each day. Some of the technical work could be accomplished only by the two primary developers but participants of varying skill levels helped with content evaluation and revision, and the editing and migration of some content from the former pages into the new repository.</p><p>The informal sprint structure of the process, and iterative development model, allowed many staff and faculty members to provide input on the look and feel of the site as it came into being. The developers were particularly happy to see two reference and instruction librarians, the Science Librarian and Social Sciences Librarian, emerge as leaders in the redesign process. Incorporating public services librarians is integral to any library website redesign for several reasons. First, the website is often students’ first interaction with the library and sometimes their only interaction. Since instruction librarians interact regularly with students in both the classroom and the reference desk, they are well suited to identify issues students will likely encounter navigating the website. Because librarians are skilled at the research process and understand a different set of terminology (like resources, services, and collections) than users, this presents a unique challenge to make the website intuitive. Second, involving more library departments in the design of the website creates buy-in and understanding of website development processes. This makes continual improvement and iteration of the website more feasible (Vassiliadis and Stimatz 2002).</p><p>The Science Librarian and Social Sciences Librarian made recommendations for changes to the library’s homepage to address issues they and other reference and instruction librarians encountered regularly at the reference desk amongst users. After these initial changes were incorporated into the website redesign, they were then able to take the first iteration of the new website to a new sample audience, running an abbreviated user testing program among typical users, students, and faculty.</p><h3 id="using-student-focus-groups-to-gather-feedback">Using Student Focus Groups to Gather Feedback</h3><p>Once the collaborative sprint was completed and the new Library site was prototyped, the Science Librarian and Social Sciences Librarian organized basic user testing focus groups composed of student employees who worked at the circulation desk. Most were upperclassmen who had worked at the library for a few years and therefore not only had experience with the website as students but also in helping patrons utilize it. Pulling focus group participants from the pool of student employees made user testing quick and easy, as they were already in the library and being compensated for their time. The Science Librarian and Social Sciences Librarian sat down with these students to talk about how they used the website and what they wanted to see in the updated version. There were two focus group sessions, each with three student employees. The two librarians first brought up the website as it was and asked them what they thought the main function of the website was, how they found a book, what common questions they got from students and community members about the website, and what frustrations they had with the current website. Their responses detailed some of their frustration with what department phone numbers were available and where, a desire for the library hours to be in a more prominent location, and requests for the events calendar and the Quicklinks to useful resources to be better highlighted. The students had many thoughts on the old website’s design and functionality, ranging from resigned acceptance to commenting that it was “kinda cringey.”</p><p>The Science Librarian and Social Sciences Librarian then showed the students the updated website and asked about their general impressions, what else they would like to see on the homepage, what caught their eye, how they would navigate the website, and how well the mobile platform worked. The students were very enthusiastic that the new library website design resembled that of the university’s main website. This not only kept it in brand but also made it more intuitive for students, who had already learned to navigate the university’s site. They liked the consistency in having all buttons be links, the arrangement of items and use of photos, and the prominence of the catalog search bar. One student commented, “Even if this is the final version of the new website, I like it a million times more than the old site.”</p><p>While these focus groups were helpful in polishing the redesigned site, there was also further value in learning about knowledge gaps of the student employees during this process. Some did not know what a subject liaison was or had never encountered some of the library’s more popular databases. This information was useful in designing training for student employees and understanding where knowledge gaps are for students when in instruction or reference situations.</p><h3 id="website-release-and-responding-to-initial-feedback">Website Release and Responding to Initial Feedback</h3><p>Once all the content was edited, the markup formatted to match Bootstrap 4 framework requirements, and the architecture restructured, the new site was built and moved onto the library’s server to go live. At this point, the site was functional for University of Idaho students’ and researchers’ needs, but there were still smaller projects the team wanted to work on improving over time including gathering wider community feedback on the changes.</p><p>To gather community feedback, the Library’s Web Committee created a brief, six question Qualtrics survey that was linked to within the initial carousel slide on the library’s updated homepage. Within this survey, the committee asked respondents how often they visited the library’s website, whether or not they found what they were looking for on the day they responded to the survey, and if anything was confusing or difficult to use on the new website. The committee also included an open-ended question for additional comments. In the span of 7 weeks, the library received 16 responses; 12 of these indicated that they visited the library’s website at least a few times a week and, in some cases, almost every day. Overall, respondents indicated that they found what they were looking for on the newly designed website, but six stated that they could not. When prompted for more information, respondents shared that they could not locate a specific database, two specific journals, or a link to Interlibrary Loan (ILL). When comparing the newly designed website (figure 3) to its prior iteration (figure 4), these comments make sense. In the prior iteration, the Library website included links to “Popular” resources, links to find specific types of information, and a link to ILL directly below the catalog search box. These three links were still accessible from the library homepage, but they had been moved to a new Menu navigation box with no obvious signposting.</p><p>Figure 3. University of Idaho Library website search box, 8/15/2018.</p><p>Figure 4. University of Idaho Library website search box, 4/8/2018.</p><p>The Library Web Committee also presented the initial website redesign to library faculty and staff across departments for their assessment and found that their feedback on the site’s new features mirrored the respondents’ feedback from the Qualtrics user survey. Participants in both groups disliked that the search box on the redesigned site now directed visitors to only physical items instead of all the library’s physical and electronic holdings and missed having an easy link to Interlibrary Loan situated underneath the search box. Based on this input, the Web Committee released a new version of the library’s homepage that incorporated these changes: a link to Interlibrary Loan was added to the “More Research Tools” section below the search box, and visitors searching the catalog would see both physical and electronic results related to their search (figure 5).</p><p>Figure 5. University of Idaho Library website search box, 12/15/2018.</p><h3 id="collaborative-development-through-the-static-web-approach">Collaborative Development through the Static Web Approach</h3><p>The capacity for all of the Library’s Web Committee members to gather, test, and implement website design feedback on-the-fly would have been impossible if the library had not migrated from PHP to the static web. Although this migration was challenging for the Library Web Committee and the library, it led to the most successful website redesign to date. Library employees with different skills levels, perspectives, and departmental affiliations were encouraged to share their feedback directly with Library Web Committee members and in open meetings, effectively removing the “us versus them” dichotomy that had dominated prior website work.</p><p>The strong channels of communication and collaboration have continued, fostering a greater sense of ownership over web features across the library. This past summer, for instance, reference services meetings discussed the trend of proactive chat boxes to increase engagement with patrons. With her experience on the web redesign, the Science Librarian knew it could be implemented, and sat down with the Digital Infrastructure Librarian to flesh out the concept. In a short time, the feature was deployed throughout the site. This ability to communicate, then rapidly move from idea to concrete prototypes and implementation, is supported by this approach.</p><p>Another recent example comes from the development of a “topics of instruction” page that was driven by the library liaisons. The liaisons were interested in marketing the instruction expertise available at the library via the website. A small group of them worked on gathering input regarding expertise via a shared Google Sheet. They also identified possible means of display, noting that the American Library Association’s page on future trends (<a href="http://www.ala.org/tools/future/trends" class="uri">http://www.ala.org/tools/future/trends</a> ) was an attractive way of delineating this information. The Liaison to the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences then met with the Head of Digital and Data Services to collaborate on the project. Through a series of meetings, and then a presentation to the general faculty, the library settled on a page that allows users to filter and search the various areas of expertise (figure 6), learn more about them via modal pop-ups within the page (figure 7), and then request instruction for the topics they desire via a customized Qualtrics survey form.</p><p>Figure 6. A portion of the University of Idaho Library Topics of Instruction page, 1/30/2020, <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/instruction/topics.html" class="uri">https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/instruction/topics.html</a></p><p>Figure 7. Modal Pop-up for Digital Collections instruction from the University of Idaho Library Topics of Instruction page (1/30/2020). Clicking on the Request Instruction button leads a user to a customized Qualtrics survey form.</p><p>To finalize the page, the Liaisons then gathered additional data to better describe the topics listed, via the same Google Sheet. In order to regenerate the page with the new data, the developer downloads the Google spreadsheet as a CSV, replaces the former CSV with that data, then re-builds the site using a Jekyll command, after which he replaces the former page with the revised one. The process demonstrates the agility of this static web approach, as the implementation takes the developer about two minutes while allowing for collaborative content development on a complex web feature using input from librarians across library departments.</p><h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2><h3 id="benefits-and-challenges-of-the-static-web-approach">Benefits and Challenges of the Static Web Approach</h3><p>The University of Idaho Library’s experience implementing a static web approach suggests there are a variety of benefits and unique opportunities in adopting this methodology as an alternative to standard CMS solutions, including minimized infrastructure barriers, project agility, and increased staff collaboration and professional growth.</p><p>First, static generators enable simplified infrastructure that requires less technical investment to start and maintain servers and systems. There is no need to configure PHP, update CMS platforms, or maintain a separate staging server with the attendant version control challenges. This also removes significant security risks. The web team had an unfortunate experience where an unused, unpatched WordPress instance was compromised via a plugin that injected advertising into its pages, an incident that made them eager for the peace-of-mind of a fully static server. The minimal hosting requirements allowed a move away from library managed hardware to a basic virtual server managed by central ITS. The static approach enables the library to do more with less IT / sysadmin support, removing technical, budget, and staffing barriers, and refocusing energy on central elements of the site including user experience, site structure, and improved aesthetics.</p><p>Second, by focusing on re-usable data and content, this static web approach ensures project agility. This focus stems in part from the web team’s experience developing the library’s digital collection sites. They saw an opportunity to utilize the data-driven capacities of modern static web to build digital collections sites around spreadsheets of well-crafted metadata and digital objects, both of which can be easily transferred to other platforms in the future.</p><p>When it came time to rethink the library website, this focus on data also became the model. Now, the content of the library website is treated as data: many web pages are built from CSVs initially created in Google Sheets, which simplifies updates and collaboration. This approach has been applied to much of the website and is especially useful when building those pages that include repeating chunks of content, such as directories, resource lists, or FAQs. As with the library’s digital collections, organizing the site’s content as data ensures that it is prepared for inevitable migration or rebranding projects.</p><p>The benefits of this site structure, however, extend further than an increased capacity for migration: because both experienced web team members and more novice library users can easily access and edit this content in its data format, changes can be rapidly deployed to respond quickly to feedback and keep the site up to date. The flexibility of this iterative and data-driven development model encourages experimentation and play by the site’s developers, lowering the barriers to implementing new ideas and concepts and enabling incremental improvements to the code.</p><p>Finally, besides more in-depth collaboration, this model has created opportunities for colleagues to grow new skills relevant to library work that they might not otherwise encounter. A 2016 survey asking librarians “what technology skill would you like to learn to help you do your job better?” found the top two responses were programming and web skills, which they perceived would help them solve issues, communicate better, and bring new tech into the library (Maceli and Burke 2016). Participating in a static web project provides this opportunity, exposing collaborators to the backend of the website and empowering them to make changes as they develop fundamental code and data skills.</p><p>One of the major drivers of silos and work division in academic libraries and similar institutions are the systems employed to deliver library services. By opening up the development workflows, code, and data driving the library website development, library personnel from all areas of the library can develop a deeper understanding and strong sense of ownership over the main access point and consumer of all these systems, the library website. At University of Idaho Library, this new approach has fostered a collaborative spirit that has opened cross-departmental channels of communication across the library. Because library staff better understand what is possible for altering website content, the web team now enjoys more efficient and rewarding conversations among everyone invested in the website’s efficacy and usefulness. Though the learning curve for editing page content is steeper for a static site than a CMS-based approach, once the foundational skills have been mastered, contributors’ return on investment includes increased control and customization of site content and their own private development space in which to learn and practice skills.</p><h3 id="lib-static-a-methodology">Lib-STATIC, a methodology</h3><p>The benefits presented here have potential beyond University of Idaho Library’s project and local context. They are part of a growing community of library developers exploring the potential of static development approaches for digital scholarship, digital collections, and web projects of all types. This approach is an emerging methodology that offers a viable alternative to the heavy web infrastructure typically employed in libraries, with the potential to fundamentally reshape librarians’ relationship to development. To further support this approach and, most importantly, grow a community of practice around it, the authors have termed this methodology “Lib-STATIC,” and have created a website that will start gathering resources, recipes, and ideas: <a href="https://lib-static.github.io/" class="uri">https://lib-static.github.io/</a> .</p><p>At its core, Lib-STATIC recognizes that librarians are fundamentally adept at many of the central needs of online applications—namely metadata/data creation and analysis, content description and classification, and assessment—and seeks to build tools that respect and utilize these skills. Ultimately, this frees librarians from devoting all their time to learning specific proprietary library platforms, allowing them instead to focus their attention on using data and learning web skills that can be applied to lightweight, open source web applications to fit their needs and reflect the unique context and values of the library. This developmental freedom does have its drawbacks as it requires a greater initial investment of time and energy from librarians learning the tools and techniques, as well as an ongoing responsibility to manage code and dependencies outside the comfortable confines of a CMS. For a certain type of library, the approach, however, offers great potential for librarians’ and for library websites. To that end, and to help others learn and employ this approach, the Lib-STATIC website will be built out in the immediate future to feature a network of library projects using static web tools, recipes, and solutions for building sites, and documentation to help others get started.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The University of Idaho Library’s static web approach is a user-focused development, design, and deployment strategy that seeks to combine the best of open tools like Jekyll and Git to create easily editable but sophisticated websites. As detailed above, the technical process and project management have moved through several foundational stages of developing this strategy, which culminated in the process used to redesign the University of Idaho Library website in the summer of 2018. While these technical solutions were initially motivated by practical and pragmatic forces related to having only two developers, as well as site security and user experience, this work quickly allowed University of Idaho librarians to discover the potential for web development using a static web-based approach, which the authors have termed Lib-STATIC, as a truly collaborative process that can engage librarians across a variety of technical skill levels.</p><p>Lib-STATIC is not a panacea for web development at all libraries, and the approach is more difficult than many GUI-based systems for those first learning the various tools and technologies involved. The methodology, however, provides librarians with a framework for developing and using tools that better embody general library principles of access and usability, while also removing some of the overwrought and expensive systems currently permeating many libraries. As a community, Lib-STATIC has some distance to go in developing more tools and means for others to implement this development approach, but there is a chance, due to the approach’s alignment with the general principles of many librarians, that it will gain some purchase across academic libraries and other GLAM institutions.</p><h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2><p>The authors received support from Institute of Museum and Library Services in National Leadership Grants for Libraries Program award, LG-34-19-0064-19, CollectionBuilder: A Digital Exhibit Platform and Static Web Development Model for Libraries, Built by Librarians (<a href="https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/grants/lg-34-19-0064-19/proposals/lg-34-19-0064-19-full-proposal.pdf" class="uri">https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/grants/lg-34-19-0064-19/proposals/lg-34-19-0064-19-full-proposal.pdf</a> ).</p><h2 id="section"></h2><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Biilmann, Matt. 2015. “Why static site generators are the next big thing.” <em>Smashing Magazine</em>, November 2. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/" class="uri">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/</a> .</p><p>Buell, Jesi, and Mark Sandford. 2018. “From Dreamweaver to Drupal: A University Library Website Case Study.” <em>Information Technology and Libraries</em> 37 (2): 118–26. <a href="https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v37i2.10113" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v37i2.10113</a> .</p><p>Connell, Ruth Sara. 2013. “Content Management Systems: Trends in Academic Libraries.” <em>Information Technology and Libraries</em> 32 (2): 42–55. <a href="https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v32i2.4632" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v32i2.4632</a> .</p><p>Davis, Robin Camille. 2015. “Git and GitHub for Librarians.” <em>Behavioral &amp; Social Sciences Librarian</em> 34 (3): 158–164. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01639269.2015.1062586" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1080/01639269.2015.1062586</a> <em>.</em></p><p>Eaton, Mark Edward. 2018. “A Comparative Analysis of the Use of GitHub by Librarians and Non-Librarians.” <em>Evidence Based Library &amp; Information Practice</em> 13 (2): 27–47. <a href="https://doi.org/10.18438/eblip29291" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.18438/eblip29291</a> <em>.</em></p><p>Hubble, Ann, Deborah A.
