# Conclusion

The University of Idaho Library's static web approach is a user-focused development, design, and deployment strategy that seeks to combine the best of open tools like Jekyll and Git to create easily editable but sophisticated websites. As detailed above, the technical process and project management have moved through several foundational stages of developing this strategy, which culminated in the process used to redesign the University of Idaho Library website in the summer of 2018. While these technical solutions were initially motivated by practical and pragmatic forces related to having only two developers, as well as site security and user experience, this work quickly allowed University of Idaho librarians to discover the potential for web development using a static web-based approach, which the authors have termed Lib-STATIC, as a truly collaborative process that can engage librarians across a variety of technical skill levels.

Lib-STATIC is not a panacea for web development at all libraries, and the approach is more difficult than many GUI-based systems for those first learning the various tools and technologies involved. The methodology, however, provides librarians with a framework for developing and using tools that better embody general library principles of access and usability, while also removing some of the overwrought and expensive systems currently permeating many libraries. As a community, Lib-STATIC has some distance to go in developing more tools and means for others to implement this development approach, but there is a chance, due to the approach's alignment with the general principles of many librarians, that it will gain some purchase across academic libraries and other GLAM institutions.
