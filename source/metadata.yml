description: |
  In 2018, a university-wide brand update prompted the University of Idaho Library to re-examine their website development practices and move towards a static web approach that leverages librarian skillsets and provides the library greater control over its systems and data. This case study describes the methodological reasons behind the decision to use the static site generator Jekyll over a Content Management System (CMS) and the practical steps taken to create a sustainable and agile development model. The article details the ways this static web approach (nicknamed “Lib-STATIC”) facilitates cross-departmental communication, collaboration, and innovative feature development for library staff members of varying technical abilities.
